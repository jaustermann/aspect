# model returns the correct viscosity for the specified
# viscous flaws, brittle parameters and geotherm. The 
# model (100x100 km) contains two distinct materials
# (crust & mantle), with the crust (upper 30 km) specified
# by a compositional field. The specified geotherm is typical
# of the continental lithosphere. The top and bottom boundaries  
# have fixed temepratures (sides are insulating), while all the
# boundaries are free-slip (tangential velocity b.c.). The strain-rate

# As we only want to check the viscosity profile, no need to do more
# than 1 nonlinear iteration. See additional comments below for more details.

# opposed to using advect compositional fields, we will track the integrated
# strain and crust via particles that carry information (see Traceris subsection
# under Postprocesses subsection).  In addition to specifying that we are 
# particles to track properties, we also must specify what particle properties
# are "mapped" at each time step to a separate compositional field accessed
