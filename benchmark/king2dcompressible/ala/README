This folder contains input files for the benchmark
King, Scott D., et al. (2010): "A community benchmark for 2-D 
Cartesian compressible convection in the Earth's mantle." 
Geophysical Journal International 180(1), 73-87.
This includes versions for the ALA and TALA approximations for 
different values of the Dissipation number Di and the Rayleigh 
number Ra. The complete input file can be found in 'ala.prm'. 
All other input files only contain the modifications necessary 
to run cases with a different approximation or values of Di and Ra, 
and the files can be combined using cat, for example

  cat ala.prm tala.prm ala_Di05_Ra5.prm | ./aspect --

to run a model with the TALA approximation, Di=0.5 and Ra=10^5. 

The bash script 'get_statistics' can extract the relevant statistics
(Nusselt number, root mean square velocity, average temperature, 
total shear heating and total adiabatic heating in the last time step) 
of one or several model runs and copy it to the screen output and a 
separate file (king_statistics.txt)
It takes one or several paths to a number of statistics 
files as input parameters, for example:

bash get_statistics Di1_Ra4

or 

bash get_statistics Di025_Ra4 Di05_Ra4 Di1_Ra4

(assuming Di025_Ra4, Di05_Ra4, Di1_Ra4 are the output directories of
the model runs).
